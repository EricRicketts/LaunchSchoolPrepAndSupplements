1.  For written material try the SQ3R method, survey the material for main topics, then write down the main topics in the form
of a question.  Then record your answers under each question.  After you have finished recording your answers, write a summary
from memory, and finally review your notes to make sure you did not miss anything.  SQ3R stands for Survey, Question, Read,
Recite, and Review.

This method is very well suited to dense material, like programming books or classes, because it forces you to filter the
material as you read it and come up with what you consider to be the most important concepts.

2.  Mapping - this might be good to try to get "the big picture".  It is visual in nature, in that one starts with a concept
in the center of the page, which is drawn with a box around it.  Then you branch of from the box with lines or arrows into
sub-concpets which are enclosed in an oval.  In turn, each of these ovals can have additional sub-concepts attached to them.
I think this might be helpful when learning something new, like HTTP, which has a lot of steps associated with the entire
process.  This way, I can capture the flow of the most important ideas.  The XMind software helps make these diagrams.

3.  Cornell - If taking notes on a paper, divide the paper vertically into two sections.  2 and 1/2 inches from the left is your
"Cues" section, the remaining 6 inches is your note taking section.  As you take notes in the not taking section, jot down themes
or big picture ideas in your "Cues" section, this way you systematically group your notes as you go.  I can see how this can be
combined with the SQ3R method.  Also, the Cornell method advocates a Summary at the end of a given section of notes.
